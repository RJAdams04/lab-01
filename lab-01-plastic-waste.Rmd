### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

*Most countries produce relatively little plastic waste aside from a few in Europe, Asia, and North America. Oceania and South America produce little plastic waste compared to the other continents while Africa is in the middle*

#```{r plastic-waste-continent}
#    ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
#  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) + facet_wrap(~ continent)
#```


### Exercise 2

#```{r plastic-waste-density}
#   ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
#       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
#                     color = continent, 
#                     fill = continent)) +
#  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)
```

### Exercise 3

*The fill and colour of the curves were aesthetics because they relate to how representation is created, while the alpha value is a modification to the finished representation*

### Exercise 4
#The violin plots do not reveal the outliers in the same way that box plots do 

#```{r plastic-waste-violin}
#   ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
#       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
#                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
#  geom_violin()
#```
